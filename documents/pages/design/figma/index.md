# Iconify for Figma

You can install Iconify for Figma from [Iconify plug-in page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/Iconify).

With Figma plug-in you can:

- Import icons.
- See HTML and React code for imported icons.
- Drag/drop icons from search results to Figma document.
- Import custom SVG by pasting code. It also decodes `[str]data:` URI.

Plug-in remembers last page you have visited, making it easy to continue searching or browsing icons. You can always reset plug-in from options page.

For visitors that have small monitors, plug-in offers compact mode. Click menu (3 lines) link, enable compact width option.

More documentation will be added when new version of Iconify for Figma is available.
