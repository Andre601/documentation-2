# Iconify for Sketch

Currently, Iconify for Sketch is based on first version of [Icon Finder](../../icon-finder/index.md). It offers basic icon search and import functionality.

For installation instructions and source code, go to [Iconify for Sketch repository](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-sketch).

More documentation will be added when new version of Iconify for Sketch is available.
