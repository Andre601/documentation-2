# Iconify for designers

For UI designers, Iconify offers plug-ins for popular software:

`include design/plugins`

These plug-ins allow you to find and import icons directly to your projects. All plug-ins are based on [Icon Finder](../icon-finder/index.md).

In future Iconify will offer plug-ins for publishing custom icon sets. Icon designers will be able to offer their icons to thousands of Iconify users by simply clicking few buttons.
