# Iconify for developers

Iconify is the most versatile icon framework available. It was originally designed to replace outdated icon fonts with modern SVG framework, while offering ease of use that icon fonts are famous for. Since then Iconify has evolved. It offers more icons than any other solution and various components for web app frameworks.

This section of documentation covers various ways to add icons to HTML documents and web applications.

This documentation assumes you have some familiarity with Iconify. If you are not familiar with Iconify, you are probably looking for [Iconify SVG framework documentation](../icon-components/svg-framework/index.md).
