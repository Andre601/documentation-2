# Tools for developers

Iconify offers several libraries that help with converting icons, manipulating icon sets and generating icons.

Available libraries:

- [Iconify Utils](./utils/index.md) is a set of reusable functions for working with icon sets and icon data. Supports TypeScript and ES modules.
- [Iconify Tools](./node/index.md) is a large package for converting and manipulating icons. It can import icons from various sources, clean them up and export to various formats. Version 1 does not support TypeScript, but version 2 is currently in development.

Old libraries:

- [Iconify JSON Tools](./json/index.md) is similar to [Iconify Utils](./utils/index.md), but has been deprecated. Switch to [Iconify Utils](./utils/index.md).
