Retrieving icon data from Iconify API requires visitor to be online. What if you want to use component offline or on local network?

There are several options:

- You can build [icon bundles](/sources/bundles/index.md) for icons that are used in your application, making icon data available offline.
- You can use [icon packages](/sources/npm/index.md), which is similar to icon bundles, but import icons one by one and are easier to use.
