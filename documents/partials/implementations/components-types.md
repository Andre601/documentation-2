Components that have `[str]with API` in their name are more versatile. They support [Iconify API](/sources/api/index.md), [icon bundles](/sources/bundles/index.md) and [icon components](/sources/npm/index.md).

Components that do not have `[str]with API` in their name are designed to work with [icon components](/sources/npm/index.md). All icons are bundled with component.
