Function `[func]loadIcons()` retrieves icons from Iconify API.

When to use this function:

- To preload multiple icons that you will use later. This will make sure icon data is available when needed and it will load faster.
- If you need to get icon data as soon as it is available. For example, when rendering a custom component.
