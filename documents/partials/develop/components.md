[Icon components](/icon-components/index.md) are used to render icons.

`include icon-components/components`

In addition to icon components for popular frameworks, Iconify has [SVG framework](/icon-components/svg-framework/index.md) that works as modern replacement for icon fonts.

Unlike other icon components, Iconify icon components load icon data on demand from API. No need to bundle icons, no need to load unnecessary data, though you can bundle icon data to make data available without retrieving it from API.
