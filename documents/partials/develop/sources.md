You can use Iconify with any icons.

By default, Iconify includes over 60k free icons from various icon sets, including the most popular icon sets: Material Design Icons, FontAwesome, Bootstrap Icons, EmojiOne, Noto Emoji and many other icon sets. You can browse all icons by [clicking "Browse Icons" link in navigation](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/).

Icon components do not include data for icons.

[Sources section](/sources/index.md) explains how icon components can get icon data, show various ways to retrieve icon data.

Sources are split into several parts:

- [Iconify API](/sources/api/index.md). It is used by [icon components](/icon-components/index.md) and [Icon Finder](/icon-finder/index.md).
- [Bundled icons](/icon-components/bundles/index.md). You can create icon bundles, making it easy to use icon components offline.
- [Icon packages](/sources/npm/index.md). Similar to icon bundles, but imports icons one by one and is easier to use.
