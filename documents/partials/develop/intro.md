Developers section is split into two parts: [sources](/sources/index.md) that provide icon data and [icon components](/icon-components/index.md) that render icons.

Most of the documentation assumes you have some familiarity with Iconify. If you are not familiar with Iconify, you are probably looking for [Iconify SVG framework documentation](/icon-components/svg-framework/index.md).
